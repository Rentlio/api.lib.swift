Swift client for Rentlio API
==============

Swift wrapper for official [Rentlio API](https://docs.rentl.io). This lib is heavily inspired by official documentation, and follows REST methods listed there.

The Rentlio API is organized around REST. It has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. 

JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. Also JSON is used in request body instead of form data. We donâ€™t use sandbox version where you can test your integrations. Instead, you can use a **DEMO property** and its reservations to be sure no harm is done on real data. 

Please **read official docs** before consuming this lib [https://docs.rentl.io](https://docs.rentl.io)
